# CP317 - Group Project: Laurier Course Hub (LCH)

## Overview

Laurier Course Hub (LCH) is an online interactive site designed by students, for students. LCH allows students to share resources and personal opinions on courses that they have taken for those who may take the course in the future. The site works by automatically generating a “page” for each course offered at WLU, done so by a database of courses offered. Users may choose to leave comments, upload documents, engage in discussion, and so on, for any page of their choosing. Users are able to upvote or downvote any user-posted content on a page, allowing a system for users to filter out content through the voting system
